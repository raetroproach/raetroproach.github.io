          <p>A qualitative relationship linking electromagnetism and gravity has eluded humanity for the longest time to the extent 
            that both are treated as unrelated fundamental forces in the universe. A simple but effective experiment that involves using 
            a free-falling magnet inside a copper pipe shows that the velocity of the falling magnet is constant. Taking into consideration 
            the separation of weight and gravitational force, the force that is keeping the magnet from accelerating is therefore always 
            equal to the induced Lenz force generated by the changing magnetic flux in the copper pipe. In this scenario, the necessitated 
            acceleration of the magnet to a constant velocity will induce a force that is equal to the gravitational force.</p>

          <p>In the late 300 BC Greece, Aristotle attempted to explain the nature of gravity. He believed that objects moved toward their 
            "natural place". It was also believed that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. It was only between 1589-1592 when 
            Galileo proved that all objects fall at the same rate of acceleration independent of their weight. This paved the way for 
            Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation which subsequently led to Albert Einstein's curvature of space-time theory 
            which is the basis of the mainstream theory of gravity in physics to this day.</p>
          <p>In the early 1800s, electricity, and magnetism were considered two unrelated forces independent of each other until the first 
            official publication of Hans Christian Oersted which linked the two. Consequently, this further led to Michael Faraday's discovery 
            of electromagnetic induction and the production of electromotive force (i.e., voltage). The technology that arose from these 
            discoveries was efficiently implemented by Nikola Tesla with his invention of the AC motor/generator and its subsequent systems 
            which are still widely used today.</p>
          <p>Nowadays, we consider electromagnetism and gravity as two separate forces independent of each other. Although there are a lot of 
            similarities between them there is not enough distinct relationship to link them. This research paper aims to show, through a simple 
            experiment, the relationship between electromotive force and gravitational force. The results of this experiment will optimistically 
            serve as a reference for further research and as a basis for future technologies that may spark a revolution in, but not limited to, 
            energy generation and transportation.</p>

          <p>The goal of the experiment was to measure the change in velocities of a free-falling magnet inside a vertically oriented copper pipe. 
            Since a wire loop with both ends connected exhibits the same phenomena as that of a copper pipe, the latter is used for a more uniform 
            build. The change in positions of the free-falling magnet inside the copper pipe was detected by three equally spaced, vertically 
            arranged optical transmitters/receivers, which were connected to a microcontroller as sensors. The three optical sensors were mounted 
            parallel to the copper pipe at a sufficient distance. Holes of very minute diameter were drilled through the copper pipe for the 
            optical sensors to complete a light circuit (refer to <a href="#figure1"><strong>Figure 1</strong></a>). Two methods were used to 
            measure the change in velocities of the free-falling magnet.</p>
          <p>The first method was to manually start and stop two stopwatches every time the magnet broke a light circuit. The optical sensors 
            provided visual confirmation, with inactivation of a built-in light emitting diode, every time the magnet broke a light circuit. 
            As the magnet passed through the copper pipe and broke the top light circuit, the first stopwatch was started. As the magnet broke 
            the middle light circuit, the second stopwatch was started while the first stopwatch was stopped. Lastly, as the magnet broke the 
            bottom light circuit, the second stopwatch was stopped (refer to <a href="#table1"><strong>Table 1</strong></a> for results). </p>
          <p>The second method was fully automated. A liquid crystal display was connected to the microcontroller to show the results of the 
            built-in timer/counter of the microcontroller itself. The only action the experimenter had to do was to release the magnet on the 
            top end of the copper pipe. As the magnet passed through the copper pipe and broke the top light circuit, the first timer/counter 
            was started. As the magnet broke the middle light circuit, the second timer/counter was started while the first timer/counter was 
            stopped. Lastly, as the magnet broke the bottom light circuit, the second timer/counter was stopped (refer to 
            <a href="#table2"><strong>Table 2</strong></a> for results).</p>

          <p>The varying accelerations measured in both tests were due to the imperfections of the speedometer build itself, environmental 
            factors, and human inaccuracy in measuring the values manually. Compared to the actual gravitational acceleration which is 
            9.8m/s<sup>2</sup>, the values of acceleration measured were so minute that they can be considered negligible. In ideal conditions, 
            both methods of measurement showed that the acceleration of the spherical magnet free-falling inside the copper pipe was non-existent 
            since the final velocity and initial velocity were the same.</p>
          <p>The experimental interpretation of this research paper will focus on the force interactions between electromagnetism and 
            gravity, therefore, the weight will be referenced and not mass. If weight is the cause of free-fall acceleration, then 
            differing values of weight will correspond to different free-fall accelerations accordingly. However, free-fall acceleration 
            on earth without air resistance will always be constant at 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> regardless of weight. The weight then has nothing to do 
            with a free-fall-able body's motion towards earth through a medium. A separate constant gravitational force is necessitated 
            for constant acceleration to take place. Using Occam's razor, it will be simpler to separate weight and gravitational force as 
            two distinct forces acting on a free-fall-able body in the same direction but not at the same time. Weight, in this case, is 
            then the constant induced force on a free-fall-able body due to earth's charge or potential when not in free fall while 
            gravitational force is the constant force acting on a free-fall-able body caused by a gravitational field when in free fall 
            through a medium.</p>
          <p>The results indicate that the constant reflected electromotive force induced due to the magnet's acceleration to the constant
             velocity at free fall opposes the gravitational force that keeps the same magnet from further accelerating. Since Lenz's Law 
             states that any magnetic induction will cause a magnetic field that will oppose the one that generates it, the magnet in free 
             fall will be subjected to an electromagnetic braking effect.</p>

          <p>Representing the gravitational field in this manner, where weight is independent of gravitational force and is treated as a 
            separate force,</p>
          <p>\[\overrightarrow G = \frac{\overrightarrow F_l}{I_e}\]</p>
          <p>where \(\overrightarrow G\) is the gravitational field, \(\overrightarrow F_l\) the opposing Lenz force, in this case, the reflected electromotive force, 
            and \(I_e\) the induced eddy currents, and representing the apparent displacement of the magnet due to the opposing Lenz force 
            as \(h_a\), a relationship with the existing classical Maxwell's equations can be derived by referencing the changing magnetic 
            field \(\overrightarrow B\) with respect to time,</p>
          <p>\[\frac{d}{dt} \displaystyle \int_{s}^{}\overrightarrow B . \overrightarrow {ds} = - \frac{d}{dt} \displaystyle \int_{h_a}^{}\overrightarrow G . \overrightarrow {dh_a}\]</p>
          <p>where \(s\) is the inner surface area of the pipe.</p>
          <p>The mathematical equation above represents the relationship between the magnetic field and gravitational field as abstractions 
            for the force interactions of a free-falling magnet inside a copper pipe. The changing magnetic field, due to acceleration to 
            constant velocity, generates eddy currents which in turn induces a constant Lenz force, in this case, the reflected electromotive 
            force, that opposes the free-fall acceleration. The apparent displacement in the opposite direction due to Lenz force is not 
            evident but is represented as the free-fall constant velocity which is necessitated to induce said Lenz force. At constant 
            velocity, the system is at a balanced state where the force equilibrium between the electromotive force and gravitational force 
            is achieved.</p>
